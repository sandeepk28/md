In the past I've had many problems uninstalling all Oracle
products from Windows systems. Here's my last resort method:

 

Uninstall all Oracle components using the Oracle Universal
Installer (OUI).

Run regedit.exe and delete the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Oracle key. This contains registry entires for all
Oracle products.

If you are running 64-bit Windows, you should also delete
the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Wow6432Node/Oracle key if it exists.

Delete any references to Oracle services left behind in the
following part of the registry (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Services/Ora*).
It should be pretty obvious which ones relate to Oracle.

Reboot your machine.

Delete the "C:\Oracle" directory, or whatever
directory is your ORACLE_BASE.

Delete the "C:\Program Files\Oracle" directory.

If you are running 64-bit Wiindows, you should also delete
the "C:\Program Files (x86)\Oracle" directory.

Remove any Oracle-related subdirectories from the
"C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\" directory.

Empty the contents of your "C:\temp" directory.

Empty your recycle bin.

At this point your machine will be as clean of Oracle
components as it can be without a complete OS reinstall.

 

Remember, manually editing your registry can be very
destructive and force an OS reinstall so only do it as a last resort.

 

If some DLLs can't be deleted, try renaming them, the after
a reboot delete them.
